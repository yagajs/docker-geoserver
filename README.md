## Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull
requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/yagajs/docker-geoserver/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions.
This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help
you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.
